In July I had the great opportunity to visit the annual conference of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) in San Antonio, Texas. 
With 38Â°C not the ideal temperatures for someone who chose to live close to the arctic circle, but the conference program and the great surrounding made it more than worth a visit.

I was invited to give a talk in the educational session on "Deep Learning for Image Reconstruction and Processing" organised by Jonas Teuwen, 
where I presented our work on deep learning for large-scale tomographic problems for spatio-temporal and higher dimensional problems. Including an outlook to our newest work on 
multi-scale learned iterative reconstructions.
